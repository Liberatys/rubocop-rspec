= Usage

You need to tell RuboCop to load the RSpec extension.
There are three ways to do this:

== RuboCop configuration file

Put this into your `.rubocop.yml`:

----
require: rubocop-rspec
----

or, if you are using several extensions:

----
require:
 - rubocop-rspec
 - rubocop-performance
----

Now you can run `rubocop` and it will automatically load the RuboCop RSpec
cops together with the standard cops.

=== RSpec DSL configuration

In case you https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/b0d0843a285693c64cdbe0c85726db155b46047e/lib/rspec/core/configuration.rb#L1122[define aliases for RSpec DSL], i.e. examples, example groups, hooks, or include example statements, you need to properly configure it so those elements are properly detected by RuboCop-RSpec.

[source,ruby]
----
# spec/spec_helper.rb
alias_example_group_to
RSpec.configure do |c|
  c.alias_example_group_to :detail, :detailed => true
end

# spec/detail_spec.rb
RSpec.detail "a detail" do
  it "can do some less important stuff" do
  end
end
----

[source,yaml]
----
# .rubocop.yml
RSpec:
  Language:
    ExampleGroups:
      Regular:
        - detail
----

Some libraries extensively define RSpec DSL aliases (e.g. Pundit, ActionPolicy) or augment existing elements providing the same semantics (e.g. `let_it_be` from `test-prof`)
Those libraries can provide necessary configuration, but won't necessarily do so.
If they do, their README will mention that you have to explicitly require their configuration from your `.rubocop.yml` file.

[source,yaml]
----
# .rubocop.yml

require:
 - rubocop-rspec
 - test-prof

# or

RSpec:
  Language:
    Helpers:
      - let_it_be
----

NOTE: the default merge mode is to inherit, so you won't remove any of the default settings.

RuboCop-RSpec's https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-rspec/blob/a43424527c09fae2e6ddb133f4b2988f6c46bb2e/config/default.yml#L6[default configuration] is a good source of information on what can be configured.

== Command line

[source,bash]
----
$ rubocop --require rubocop-rspec
----

== Rake task

[source,ruby]
----
RuboCop::RakeTask.new do |task|
  task.requires << 'rubocop-rspec'
end
----

== Code Climate

`rubocop-rspec` is available on Code Climate as part of the rubocop engine. https://codeclimate.com/changelog/55a433bbe30ba00852000fac[Learn More].

== Inspecting files that don't end with `_spec.rb`

By default, `rubocop-rspec` only inspects code within paths ending in `_spec.rb` or including `spec/`. You can override this setting in your config file by setting `Include`:

[source,yaml]
----
# Inspect files in `test/` directory
RSpec:
  Include:
    - '**/test/**/*'
----

[source,yaml]
----
# Inspect only files ending with `_test.rb`
RSpec:
  Include:
    - '**/*_test.rb'
----

NOTE: Please keep in mind that `Include`'s merge mode is set to override the default settings, so if you intend to add a path, while keeping the default paths, you should include the default include paths in your configuration.
